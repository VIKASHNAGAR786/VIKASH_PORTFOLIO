  </h2>
  
  <p class="mb-5 fs-5 lh-lg">
    Hey there! I'm <strong class="text-primary">Vikash Nagar</strong>, a full-stack developer passionate about building beautiful,
    scalable web apps. I blend design, logic, and cloud technologies to solve real-world problems.
    I thrive on turning ideas into polished digital solutions and believe that great software should be as elegant
    behind the scenes as it is in the userâ€™s hands.

      I'm pursuing my BCA at <strong>Poornima University, Rajasthan</strong>. Iâ€™ve developed multiple full-stack projects using
      <strong>.NET, Angular, Java, Python</strong>, and <strong>Salesforce</strong> â€” all focused on real-world impact.
      From designing robust database models to implementing responsive frontends, I enjoy the entire software lifecycle.
      I've also completed certifications in cloud platforms and actively contribute to GitHub.

    <h4 class="text-warning fw-semibold"><i class="bi bi-rocket-takeoff-fill me-2"></i>Mission</h4>
    <p class="mt-2 text-light">
      I strive to contribute to meaningful tech that improves lives. I also run a free YouTube channel â€”
      <strong>LargeCoder</strong> â€” to help others break into tech with practical, real-world knowledge.
      My mission is to democratize tech education and ensure that students from rural backgrounds or small towns
      get the same exposure and guidance as those in big cities.
      I believe in the power of sharing and that knowledge grows when we give it away.

    <h4 class="text-success fw-semibold"><i class="bi bi-emoji-smile me-2"></i>Fun Fact</h4>
    <p class="mt-2 text-light">
      One day, I want to retire in my village and keep building useful tools â€” but this time, surrounded by nature ðŸŒ±.
      I envision setting up a small tech hub where I can mentor kids, contribute to open-source projects,
      and build solutions for local problems â€” like smart farming, rural e-commerce, or educational platforms.

    <h4 class="text-danger fw-semibold"><i class="bi bi-heart-fill me-2"></i>What I Value</h4>
    <p class="mt-2 text-light">
      Clean code, continuous learning, community impact, and humility. I take pride in writing readable,
      maintainable code and believe that good developers never stop learning.
      Whether it's through reading docs, experimenting with new frameworks, or teaching others,
      I'm always leveling up.
